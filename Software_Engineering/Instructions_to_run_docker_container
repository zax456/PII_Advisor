1. Download Software_Engineering folder
2. Make sure Docker Toolbox is installed
3. Start Docker Quickstart Terminal
4. Change working directory to folder which was downloaded previously in the terminal
5. Run the command: "docker build -t first_docker ."
6. Run the command: "docker run --rm -p 5000:80 first_docker" to run the image created previously
7. If reading files from external drives, run this command: "docker run -p 5000:80 -v path/to/resume_folder:path/to/name_of_app image_name"
    E.g. "docker run -p 5000:80 -v D:\AKH_Folder\Work\University\Year 4 Sem 1\BT3101 Business Analytics Capstone Project\pii\data_science\unit_tests\sample_resumes:usr/src/app python:3-onbuild"


# To restart container
1. Ctrl + C or Cmd + C in your terminal
2. Run the command "docker kill $(docker ps -q)"
3. Run the command "docker build -t first_docker ." to rebuild the image if there are any changes 
4. Run the command "docker run --rm -p 5000:80 first_docker" to run the image again
5. Run the command "docker kill $(docker ps -q)" to stop all containers

# To mount a local directory to Docker
Replace step 6 with:
docker run --rm -p 5000:80 -it -v /desired/path:/dst first_docker
This would link the local `source` folder with the `dst` folder in the Docker, with read/ write access. Changes made from the Docker would be reflected in the local directory.

To see the file system within Docker, run:
docker run -it -v debian bash  
This can allow you to better visualise the file paths. 

If you would like to see how `dst` could be created, run this:
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)":/dst debian bash
This command appends your current directory into the `dst` directory in Docker

* Joseph recommends putting all our commands into a `docker-compose.yml` to automate them eventually.
